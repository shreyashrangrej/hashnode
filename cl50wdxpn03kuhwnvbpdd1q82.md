## Using VS Code like IDE on SAP BTP for FREE!

# Introduction 
It's called 'SAP Business Application Studio' and by the name itself, you might guess that this service is specially designed to develop business applications natively for SAP end users. But it's like every other IDE and therefore can be used to develop other applications as well. 

SAP Business Application Service comes as a service with trial and paid plans for SAP BTP (Cloud Platform). This service runs on a cloud foundry environment on AWS, Azure, or GCP data centers.

Of course in this article, I'm gonna show how we can create a free trial account and access SAP Business Application studio. Without further due let's get started.

### Create an SAP account
